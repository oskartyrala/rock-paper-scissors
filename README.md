Two major lessons learnt here: 
1. Design your page before you start coding. Sitting down with Adobe XD
and designing the layout before I even started coding the UI was much better
and proved to be faster overal rather than trying out stuff while coding.
2. Write your code properly the first time around. At first, I would just write
messy code that I knew would work because I wanted to see results fast.
I did plan on coming back to "fix" it later, but that's not the best approach.
When coming back to fix code at the end, you don't always remember everything
and since your code is not clean, it might be harder to read and figure it out
so that you can rewrite it. Do it right the first time around.
